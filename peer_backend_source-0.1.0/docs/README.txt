Welcome to Infinity Economics (XIN).

This is the peer backend reference implementation of Infinity.

We currently do our client and server development on Debian/Ubuntu desktops, we find it to be 
an excellent open source free! and secure platform. While we try and help new developers coming 
to XIN  as best as possible, it is unfortunately not possible to include detailed step by 
step instructions for platforms that are not Debian based. In time it is our goal to include 
detailed step by step instructions for all platforms. 

This peer backend is used to support and feed the XIN light client with open nodes, services
and additonal backends on demand.
